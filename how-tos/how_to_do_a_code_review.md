# How To Do a Code Review

## Goals
Code review is the step to complete the task. Logically, code review preceds Demo session. The one should not mix up these two items.

Mentor should verify that Mentee's code does not contain major design flaws.
Check that the code is in a good shape: has proper comments, reasonable formatting, consistent naming conventions.
Suggest ideas on how the same things could be implemented better, that is suggest methods for refactoring and etc.

Mentee's benefit from the Code review is Mentors insigh.

Mentor's benefit from the Code review is finding of potentially good ideas and constructions the Mentee is using and noting them for the future. On the other hand, this is a practice of code review skill.

## Scheduling Code Review

Code review should be triggered as soon as all functionality and initial code clean up is done by Mentee. The Mentor can perform personal code review before "public" one, but it is not obligatory. It is Mentor's responsibility to push other Mentor to review the code.

The minimum reviewer of the code is other Mentor & Mentee (cross-review).

## How To Initiate a Code Review

Mentee is supposed to create a Pull Request from task branch to master (main) and send this PR to own Mentor, other Mentor & Mentee.
