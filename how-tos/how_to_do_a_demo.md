# How To Do a Demo

## Goals
Demo is the step to complete the task. Logically, code review preceds Demo session. The one should not mix up these two items.

During Demo Mentee should:
+ Demonstrate the results of the work, that is working application.
+ Outline the design of the application.
+ Practice in public presentations.

Mentee's benefit from the Demo is all the things mentioned above.

Mentor's benefit from the Demo is in orchestration skills development.

## Scheduling Demo

Demo session should take place within five days after Code review was triggered. 

The minimum number of attendees for the demo session is one Mentee (presenter) and two mentors (own & other).

Group coordinator(or Mentor) is responsible for scheduling the demo session

## Demo Timings
Recommended time slot for the demo is one hour. Thought in exceptional cases the demo could take more time, up to hour and a half, but not more. It is Mentor's responsibility to orcestrate the demo flow to fit into time frame.

The recommended timings are listed in the table below. Questions can be asked between actions and in the end of the demo, if the time allows.

| # | Action | Duration, minutes | Suggested Timing |
| - | ------ | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| 1	| Describe given task in brief. | 3 | 0:00 - 0:03 |
