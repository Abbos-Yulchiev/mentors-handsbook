# Criteria For Rating

1. Whether the task was completed on time or not?
2. Have all the requirements for the assignment been met or not? For this point it is necessary to consider the following items (with example):
    * If mentee misunderstood the requirement (for instance, implemented a search by name and by description separately, although it was necessary to provide the ability to search by both fields at the same time), this can be considered as a minor issue, that should be fixes for the next demo.
    * If mentee did not fulfill the requirement (did not implement search), this can be considered as a major issue and directly affects the rating (decreasing). BTW, such issue also should be fixes for the next demo session.
3. If mentee did the extra task, it increases his rating
4. Whether mentee fixed all issues from previous demo or not?
5. Theoretical part - assesses student's understanding of theory, not just knowledge.
6. Don't forget about soft skills. If there are any concerns in communication or behavior - this should affect the rating.
