# Criteria For Rating

1. Whether the task was completed on time or not?
2. Have all the requirements for the assignment been met or not? For this point it is necessary to consider the following items (with example):
    * If mentee misunderstood the requirement (for instance, implemented a search by name and by description separately, although it was necessary to provide the ability to search by both fields at the same time), this can be considered as a minor issue, that should be fixes for the next demo.
    * If mentee did not fulfill the requirement (did not implement search), this can be considered as a major issue and directly affects the rating (decreasing). BTW, such issue also should be fixes for the next demo session.
3. If mentee did the extra task, it increases his rating
4. Whether mentee fixed all issues from previous demo or not?
5. Theoretical part - assesses student's understanding of theory, not just knowledge.
6. Don't forget about soft skills. If there are any concerns in communication or behavior - this should affect the rating.

## How to fill in feedback doc (run December 2020)

1. Doc with feedback/timeline: https://epam-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/maryia_zharykava_epam_com/_layouts/15/doc2.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BC837F6C3-62CF-49DB-8FF3-DD1FA664E1D5%7D&file=MJC.School.run.december.2020.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&cid=05a21eef-7972-4d1f-a5a5-228bc571ad58
2. Column comment - indicate when the mentee started the task, and when there was a demo (example: Module started: 12/24/2020 Demo: 01/04/2021), if the mentee got sick/if the mentee was invited for an interview/some other exceptional cases for the mentor/mentor, this is also better tracked in this column.
3. Column rating - the mentor fills in a rating based on the results of the demo (maximum 4, minimum 1, if a task has been done without an additional task - mark is 4, if it has been completed with an additional task, mark should be also 4 + note in the feedback, that an additional task has been done).
4. Column feedback - the mentor gives feedback on the demo results (example: what was good/what was not so good/action items).
5. Column manual feedback - if someone besides the mentor was present at the demo (co-mentor/other mentor/developer from production project), then this column will contain their feedbacks in the same format ^^ (example: from Maryia Zharykava: ...).
6. The mentor shares feedback with the mentee in a convenient form for both of them, all action items should be fixed to the next demo.
